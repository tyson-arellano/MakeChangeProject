## Lessons Learned 
	Its amazing how simple solutions can evade me at first.
	I had no idea how to solve this and I tried a number of
	if / else  statements and for loops to try to get each 
	denomonation seperately. After thinking through it and 
	taking many breaks, I realized that I needed to store
	the remaining change after I checked if each denomination 
	was going to be able to be used to return the correct 
	amopunt of  with the right denomination. I also realized 
	that I needed to do this from biggest denomination, 
	(twenties in this case), to the smallest (pennies). 
	Seems simple since thats how you would give change in the 
	real world, but I was trying to get pennies first! HA! 
	But once I had these revalations, the rest was a breeze! 

	If at first you don't succeed, take a break and come 
	back to it. Do that as many times as it takes.
