## Lessons Learned 
	Its amazing how simple solutions can evade me at first.
	I tried solving this without a for loop and I was able 
	to get the pennies accurately but that is where the 
	solution stopped. It wasn't until i realized I needed 
	to store the remaining change after I cycled through 
	each denomiation that I realized that a for loop was 
	necessary.Onece I established that the math became a
	bit easier and I was able to flow through this. 

	If at first you don't succeed, take a break and come 
	back to it. Do that as many times as it takes.
